# What our program does
Our program takes the user's name, age, favorite color, and favorite season and then prints it all out. This is not open-source. You can download it from the repository by using git clone "repository_url".

# About our Liscence 
The license we chose to use is the Python Software Foundation or "PSD". It is a BSD license (a type of permissive free software license). There are not many restrictions on the use and distribution of our software. Our license allows the modification and distribution of our software as well. Having our license be open source will allow our users to have more freedom while using our software. It will allow them to branch off of our software and maybe create something new. With more restrictions users are unable to express their creativity.

# How to Contribute - Code of Conduct
We chose to adopt the Contributor Covenant written by Coraline Ada Ehmke as our Code of Conduct. This code of conduct is widespread, and so should be familiar to the users of our program. The community guidelines are clear and in line with our beliefs. The enforcement policies scale up with the severity or repetition of an incident. Contributors should follow our code of conduct in order to ensure a successful and positive project environment.
